I have included notes at key points throughout the `index.html` file to help the user define excactly what AMP dictates must be present in order for a Web Story to qualify to appear in Google searches.

As of 6 October 2020, all qualifying Web Stories now have the potential to appear in the [Discover section of the Google app](https://blog.google/web-creators/web-stories-discover-search).
Google has announced official support for the Web Stories format and plans to expand data analysis and advertising integrations accordingly.

Developer docs from [AMP](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/?format=stories) and [Google](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/enable-web-stories) provide additional details about creating and publishing Web Stories.

Credit for these resources goes to [amp.dev](https://amp.dev/documentation/components/amp-story), where anyone who wishes to learn about Web Stories will find [Create Your First Web Story](https://amp.dev/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/start/visual_story/?format=stories), which is an interactive tutorial where you will build a template just like this one.
